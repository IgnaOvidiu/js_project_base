# JS Project base

Simple starter template

Includes:

`parcel` - [GitHub](https://github.com/parcel-bundler/parcel) for bundling

`dotenv` - [GitHub](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv) for any secrets and sensitive data

`eslint` config with `air-bnb` [ESLint AirBNB](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript) [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) for linting

`prettier` [GitHub](https://prettier.io/) for formatting

Does **not** include any CSS frameworks because that's the dealer's choice

# Requirements for project
